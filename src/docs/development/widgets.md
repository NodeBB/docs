Writing Widgets for NodeBB
==========================

See the original [blog post](http://blog.nodebb.org/widgets-system/) for
a high level overview and screenshots of the widget system.

Embedding HTML and JavaScript
-----------------------------

You don't need to be a developer to figure this out. Head over to the
Themes control panel and click on the Widgets tab. Create a new HTML
widget by dragging and dropping the widget onto whatever template you
want.

Copy and paste HTML or JavaScript into the widget and hit save - you're
done!

You can optionally give your widget a container by dragging and dropping
from the containers section onto your selected widget.

If you're looking for some sample scripts, head over to our [plugins
section](http://community.nodebb.org/category/7/nodebb-plugins) and look
for any topic labelled `nodebb-script-xyz`. Don't forget to submit your
scripts and ideas as well!

Creating Widgets
----------------

You can define widgets in both plugins and themes. If you're building a
plugin which simply delivers a widget (or collection of widgets), we
strongly suggest you follow the `nodebb-widget-xyz` nomenclature instead
when publishing.

### Registering your widget

Listen to this hook to register your widget:

``` json
"hook": "filter:widgets.getWidgets", "method": "defineWidgets", "callbacked": true
```

Pass this back in the array:

``` json
 {
     widget: "widget_namespace",
     name: "My Widget",
     description: "Short description of what it does.",
     content: "<input type=\"text\" name=\"myKey\" class=\"form-control\" />"
 }
```

`Content` defines the form that is displayed to customize your widget in
the admin panel.

### Listening to your widget

NodeBB core will call your widget on the appropriate page load by way of
the hooks system. The hook will be named after your widget's namespace
(see previous example) - like so:
`filter:widget.render:widget_namespace`

This will pass in a `widget` object with the following useful properties:

-   `widget.area` - that defined by hook `filter:widgets.getAreas` (see
    section below) - will have `location`, `template`, `url`
-   `widget.data` - will have your admin-defined data; in the example from
    the previous section you will be exposed an `obj.data.myKey`
-   `widget.req` - [req object](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#req)
    represent current HTTP request.

You render widget by assigning HTML to `widget.html`. For example:

```javascript
Plugin.renderWidget = function (widget, callback) {
  widget.html = '<h1>Hello world !</h1>';
  callback(null, widget);
};
```

Or you can render template file by `widget.req.app.render` (
see also [templating system](./themes/templates.md)). For example:

```javascript
Plugin.renderWidget = function (widget, callback) {
  widget.req.app.render('widgets/my-widget', function (error, html) {
    widget.html = html;
    callback(error, html);
  };
};
```

Defining Widget Areas in Themes
-------------------------------

A Widget Area is characterized by a template and a location. Themes can
share widgets if they define the same Widget Areas. If an admin switches
themes, widgets that were previously defined in a Widget Area
incompatible with the new theme are saved.

Listen to this hook to register your Widget Area:

``` json
"hook": "filter:widgets.getAreas", "method": "defineWidgetAreas"
```

Pass this back in the array:

``` json
{
    widget: "categorysidebar",
    name: "Category Sidebar",
    template: "category.tpl",
    location: "sidebar"
}
```

And that's all. You can define as many Widget Areas in your theme as you
wish. If you're still stuck, have a look at [this
commit](https://github.com/NodeBB/nodebb-theme-cerulean/commit/50e49a9da5a89484fa8001bbda2e613b69f18e86)
which upgraded the Cerulean theme to use the widget system.
