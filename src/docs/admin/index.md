Administrative Functions
========================

The **Administrative Control Panel** (ACP) allows you to alter the behaviour of NodeBB, as well as customise various parts
of its look and feel. Administrative functions such as user and group management are available from here.

The ACP is only accessible to administrators, and thus should be protected from unauthorised access whenever possible.
