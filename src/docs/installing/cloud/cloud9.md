Cloud 9 IDE
===========

The following are installation instructions for the [Cloud
9](https://c9.io/) web based IDE.

**Step 1:** Clone NodeBB into a new workspace from GitHub. You can use
the following command from the terminal:

```
git clone -b v1.19.x https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB.git nodebb
```

The nodebb command after the git url will create a folder called nodebb
so you have to `cd` into that directory after you have cloned NodeBB.

**Step 2:** Install redis with Cloud9's package manager

```
nada-nix install redis
```

**Step 3:** Run your redis server on port 16379 - port 6379 tends to be
already used on Cloud 9. The "&" makes the command run in the
background. You can always terminate the process later. \$IP is a Cloud
9 system variable containing the global ip of your server instance.

```
redis-server --port 16379 --bind $IP &
```

**Step 4:** Find out your instance's ip address so NodeBB can bind to it
correctly. This is one of Cloud 9's demands and seems to be the only way
it will work. You can't use \$IP in your config.json either (which means
you can't enter \$IP in the node app --setup).

```
echo $IP
```

**Step 5:** Run the nodebb setup utility:

```
node app --setup
```

URL of this installation should be set to
'<http://workspace_name-c9-username.c9.io>', replacing workspace\_name
with your workspace name and username with your username. Note that as
NodeBB is currently using unsecure http for loading jQuery you will find
it much easier using <http://> instead of <https://> for your base url.
Otherwise jQuery won't load and NodeBB will break.

Port number isn't so important - Cloud9 may force you to use port 80
anyway. Just set it to 80. If this is another port, like 4567, that is
also fine.

Use a port number to access NodeBB? Again, this doesn't seem to make a
big difference. Set this to no. Either will work.

Host IP or address of your Redis instance: localhost (the output of the
\$IP Command is also acceptable)

IP or Hostname to bind to: Enter what your \$IP value holds here found
in step 4. It should look something like: 123.4.567.8

Host port of your Redis instance: 16379

Redis Password: Unless you have set one manually, Redis will be
configured without a password. Leave this blank and press enter

First-time set-up will also require an Admin name, email address and
password to be set.

And you're good to go! Don't use the Run button at the top if the IDE,
it has been a little buggy for me. Besides, you're better off using the
command line anyway. Run:

```
node app
```

And then open <http://workspace_name-c9-username.c9.io> in your browser.

Troubleshooting
---------------

A common problem is that the database hasn't been started. Make sure you
have set Redis up correctly and ran

```
redis-server --port 16379 --bind $IP
```
