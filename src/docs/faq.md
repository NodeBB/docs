### How do I upgrade my NodeBB to a newer version?

Please consult [Upgrading NodeBB](./configuring/upgrade.md)

### I upgraded NodeBB and now X isn't working properly!

Please consult [Upgrading NodeBB](./configuring/upgrade.md)

### I installed an incompatible plugin, and now my forum won't start!

If you know which plugin caused problems, disable it by running:
`./nodebb reset -p nodebb-plugin-pluginName`

Otherwise, disable all plugins by running: `./nodebb reset -p`

### I'm getting an "npm ERR!" error

For the most part, errors involving `npm` are due to Node.js being
outdated. If you see an error similar to this one while running
`npm install`:

``` bash
npm ERR! Unsupported
npm ERR! Not compatible with your version of node/npm: connect@2.7.11
```

You'll need to update your Node.js version to 4 or higher.

To do this on Ubuntu:

``` bash
# Using Ubuntu
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_4.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# Using Debian, as root
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_4.x | bash -
apt-get install -y nodejs
```

If successful, running the following command should show a version
higher than 0.8

``` bash
# apt-cache policy nodejs
```

### URLs on my NodeBB (or emails) still have the port number in them!

If you are using [nginx](./configuring/proxies/nginx.md) or
[Apache](./configuring/proxies/apache.md) as a reverse proxy, you
don't need the port to be shown. Simply run ./nodebb setup and specify
the base URL without a port number.

Alternatively, edit the `config.json` file using your favourite text
editor and change `use_port` to `false`.

### The "Recently Logged In IPs" section only shows 127.0.0.1

NodeBBs running behind a proxy may have difficulties determining the
original IP address that requests come from. It is important that the
proxy server provides the referral IP header.

In nginx, ensure that the following line is present in your `server`
block:

``` nginx
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
```

In addition, ensure that the `use_port` option is set to `false` in your
NodeBB's `config.json`
