# NodeBB Style Guide

Core developers follow the [AirBnB Javascript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/blob/master/README.md). This is enforced through the use of automatic eslint validation on push to the remote repository.

As a developer you must follow this style guide for all pull requests, or they will not be merged.

Third-party developers working on plugins and themes are free to disregard this style guide, although we encourage following it as a matter of best practice.

* __Note:__ client-side code must stick with ES5 spec to be minified properly.
